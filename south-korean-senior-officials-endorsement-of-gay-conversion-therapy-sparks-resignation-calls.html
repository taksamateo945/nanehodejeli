Kim also added that “some people have innate homosexual tendencies, but in many cases, I think people mistake their learned habits as natural qualities.”</span></p><p><span>He continued by saying “in such cases, I think homosexuality can be changed by receiving certain treatments, just like how smokers receive smoking cessation treatment.”</span></p><p><span>Kim also criticized media outlets for “digging” into his past.</span></p><p><span>He is a senior official under conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was sworn into office on Tuesday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yoon had made controversial remarks of his own during his campaign, </span><span>pledging</span><span> to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality if elected.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Top comments on Kim’s Facebook post included one user asking, “Don’t you need to resign soon??? And not burden the president.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another posted, “So you’re saying my taxes go to this kind of human’s salary, right? Can gay conversion therapy also treat this kind of human too? Probably not, right? Let’s drive out Yoon Suk-yeol as soon as possible and eliminate this man’s job as well.”</span></p><p><span>A campaign group called the Rainbow Action Against Sexual Minority Discrimination of Korea responded to Kim’s remarks, calling for his resignation and stating that “it has already been confirmed that the so-called conversion therapy is unscientific and goes against international human rights law.”</span></p><p><span>“As a person who declared his duty to comply with the constitution, how will Yoon take responsibility for the situation in which sexual minorities are insulted within the first two days of his term?” the group said.</span></p><p><span>Out of a population of 51 million in South Korea, nearly a quarter identify as Christian, making the religious community a politically significant group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Not only is same-sex marriage illegal in South Korea, LGBTQ-plus rights remain strongly opposed.</span></p><p><span>A Korean pastor was previously </span><span>suspended</span><span> from duty after holding a blessing ceremony at a queer festival in 2019, which allegedly violated the laws of the Korean Methodist Church (KMC).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via KBS&nbsp;(left), Getty Images (right)</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
