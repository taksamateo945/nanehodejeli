They didn’t find silver or gold but rather brass — the remains of trumpets that went down with the ship.</p><p>The collection of brass trumpets is an “exceptionally rare” find and paints a fascinating picture of 16th-century European trade patterns.</p><h2>Discovering The Brass Trumpets In Croatia</h2><p>According to a press release from the <a href=# rel=noopener>International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar</a>, underwater archaeologists discovered the 16th-century shipwreck this year near Cape Franina. During their dives, they came across pottery vessels, glass beads, red glass bowls — and brass trumpets.</p><p>“[T]he ship had a valuable cargo — numerous brass trumpets, which were exceptionally rare and costly during that period,” the press release states.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-500286 alt="Archaeologist With Wreck" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/archaeologist-with-wreck.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-500286 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar</span><span class=caption-body>An underwater archaeologist with remnants of the shipwreck, which includes trumpets, beads, bowls, and pottery.</span></p><p>Luka Bekić from the International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar <a href=# rel=noopener>told Croatian media</a> that the trumpets were “transported in pieces.”</p><p>“We can see that when looking at the number of these parts, and we know that there were more than 10 of them,” Bekić said. “There are only less than 10 trumpets from the 16th century in well-known museums across the entire world. We will thus have the largest collection of trumpets in the world.”</p><p>So, where did the trumpets come from?</p><h2>The History Of The Brass Trumpets</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-500302 alt="Underwater Archaeologists At Work" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/underwater-archaeologists-at-work.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-500302 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar</span><span class=caption-body>Underwater archaeologists investigating the site of the shipwreck in Cape Franina.</span></p><p>As the press release explains, the brass trumpets appear to have originated in Strasbourg, France, and the city of Leiden in the Netherlands. One of the best-preserved trumpets in the shipwreck was inscribed with the words “LVGDVNY BATAVORVM,” the Latin name for Leiden.</p><p>“Until now, no trumpets from those cities were known or have been preserved anywhere in the world,” the press release notes.</p><p>Because of this, archaeologists suspect that the ship was “of Dutch origin” and probably “engaged in trade between Leiden, Venice, and Constantinople.” Local media reported that it was likely transporting grain when it sank off the Croatian coast sometime in the late 16th century. That said, archaeologists are still working to learn more about the shipwreck.</p><p>Their next step is to preserve what remains on the seafloor. Underwater archaeologists also found wooden pulleys, ropes, and iron cannons, which have been cleaned and documented.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-500308 alt="Underwater Archaeologists With Iron Cannon" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/underwater-archaeologists-with-iron-cannon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-500308 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar</span><span class=caption-body>In addition to the trumpets and other cargo, archaeologists also documented several iron cannons which had gone down with the ship.</span></p><p>But while the trumpets were surfaced for further study, the ship’s cannons will remain on the seafloor. Archaeologists are hopeful that they will inspire and enchant visitors to the region moving forward.</p><p>“[T]hese iron cannons and anchors will be preserved for future tourist divers visiting this historically rich location with captivating stories,” the press release explained.</p><p>The ship that sank carrying trumpets is just one of many shipwrecks which have been documented in the region. According to Croatian media, some 20 shipwrecks have been identified, five of which — like the newest one —&nbsp;have been protected to prevent further deterioration. That way, they can all tell their fascinating stories about sea travel, trade, and the dangers of a sudden storm.</p><p>After reading about the brass trumpets found in a 16th-century shipwreck off the coast of Croatia, discover the stories behind some of <a href=#>history’s most famous shipwrecks</a>.
