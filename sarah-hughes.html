In her long program, she landed seven triple jumps, including a triple toe loop-triple loop and a triple salchow-triple loop combination. She won the long program, as the three contenders ahead of her after the short program all made mistakes in their respective long programs.

Michelle Kwan, who was in first place after the short program would have to lose the free program to Hughes and one other skater as well.
