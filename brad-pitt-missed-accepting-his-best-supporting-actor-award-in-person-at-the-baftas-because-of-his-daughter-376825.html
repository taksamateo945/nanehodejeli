At the time, the actor‚Äôs absence was explained as a ‚Äúfamily obligation,‚Äù and an insider added that ‚Äúthe children come before anything.‚Äù</p><p>Pitt stayed in Los Angeles to support both of his daughters who underwent surgery, but the source says that the Fight Club star will never speak publicly about his kids like his ex-wife.</p><p>In her essay, Jolie revealed that her oldest daughter Zahara, 15, and one of her two younger daughters ‚Äì either Shiloh, 13, or Vivienne, 11 ‚Äì both underwent operations. Recent pictures of the Jolie-Pitt clan imply that it was Shiloh who went under the knife.</p><p>With zero mention of Pitt, the Maleficent actress wrote that she had spent the last two months in and out of surgeries with her eldest daughter, and recently Zahara‚Äôs younger sister had hip surgery.</p><p>‚ÄúI have watched my daughters care for one another. My youngest daughter [Vivienne] studied the nurses with her sister, and then assisted the next time,‚Äù wrote Jolie. ‚ÄúI saw how all my girls so easily stopped everything and put each other first, and felt the joy of being of service to those they love.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Jolie didn‚Äôt reveal why Zahara had surgery, and she didn‚Äôt go into detail about her younger daughter‚Äôs hip surgery. However, she hinted at the seriousness of the situation when she wrote they were ‚Äúfighting to survive.‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Angelina Jolie also wrote in her essay that her three sons ‚Äì Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, and Knox, 11 ‚Äì were ‚Äúsupportive and sweet‚Äù when it came to their sisters. She explained that as she wrote the piece from the hospital, she found herself focusing on her daughters for a moment. She also wanted to acknowledge all of the things she has learned from them and the other young girls she has met around the world.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp66lec%2Biq61lnZ7AtLHDZpicm5Wlwaq6xmafoqtdl7K0wIysrKmon6fBqrrGZpicrJ%2BneqLDwKubZqGeYr2mvtKopWaZpGLBqbGMm5ifrJGoeqOxwpqsrJ1dpLNutMisZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZmpwbmhngnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gary Danielsons Wife Kristy Danielson?
