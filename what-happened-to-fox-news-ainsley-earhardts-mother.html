Born on January 28, 1950, she died at the age of 72, and her cause of death was not made known even though it was made known that she died peacefully.</strong></p><p>Dale Earhardt worked for more than three decades as a teacher, but she has come to be drawn to the limelight thanks to the fame of her daughter, who is one of the most known faces on Fox News. Although it is already 1 years since she died, Dale still manages to attract attention with questions bordering on the things that happened to her.</p><h2><strong>Who is Ainsley Earhardt’s Mother?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dale-Giles-Earhardt-e1703559959201.jpg><p>Ainsley Earhardt’s mother is Dale Giles Earhardt. She was born on January 28, 1950, and was 72 years old at the time of her death in October 2022. Of American nationality and white ethnicity, she was born in Greenville, South Carolina, to her parents, George Wesley Giles and Anne Giles, and she was brought up together with a sister, Lynn Giles Young.</p><p>As regards her educational pursuits, Dale went to Greenville High School from where she graduated in 1968. From there, she went to Columbia College, where she spent four years, and by the time she graduated in 1972, she had obtained a degree in Early Childhood education.</p><p>Ainsley Earhardt’s mother worked as a teacher for more than 30 years after she graduated from college and obtained a national board certification in teaching. She taught in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Charlotte, North Carolina. She later went to Anna Boyd Elementary School in Columbia, where she spent the rest of her teaching years. After she retired after 33 years, a resolution was passed in the state to honor her for her many years of service and dedication.</p><h2><strong>What happened to Ainsley Earhardt’s Mother?</strong></h2><p>Ainsley Earhardt’s mother, Dale Giles Earhardt, suffered from several health challenges for many years before she lost her life. According to her daughter, Dale’s struggles with health issues began when she was still in her late 30s. She revealed that at the age of 39, her mom was diagnosed with diabetes, but clearly, that was something she managed rather well.</p><p>At around the same time, Ainsley Earhardt’s mother was also said to be suffering from gallbladder issues at around that time, and this forced her to start undergoing dialysis to take care of the issue. It is unclear how she managed the health challenge, but she was not linked to any major health issue again until 2018, when she suffered a stroke.</p><p>Following the incident, she was nursed to health, but five years later, Dale began having some more health issues as she began deteriorating, forcing her husband to call their kids to come home to spend with her.</p><p>On October 22, 2022, she lost her life to a condition that was not made known to the public. The only thing that was shared was that her passing was peaceful. Only a few days after the death of her mom, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ainsley returned</a> to work because, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>according to her</a>, that was what her mom would have wanted.</p><h2><strong>Is Ainsley Earhardt’s Mother Alive?</strong></h2><p>No, Ainsley Earhardt’s mother is not alive. As indicated, she died in October 2022 when she was 72 years old. This means that the celebrity mom and former teacher died 1 years ago.</p><p>Her visitation was at Dunbar Funeral Home on October 30, 2022, and then as a dedicated Christian all her life, a funeral service was held for her at Eastminster Presbyterian Church on October 31, 2022.</p><h2><strong>Ainsley Earhardt Was Not Dale Earhardt’s Only Child</strong></h2><p>Although Dale is mostly known as Ainsley Earhardt’s mother, the TV personality is not her only child. Dale has two more children with her husband of at least five decades, Lewie Wayne Earhardt.</p><p>The oldest child of the family is &nbsp;Elise Giles Earhardt, who is followed by Ainsley and then Trenton Graham Earhardt. Dale and her husband raised their kids in a stable environment and as devout Christians. She was very supportive of her children in their careers, so after her passing, her kids returned to their work almost immediately.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BstaLAjKGYqaiVo7KledOoZJ%2BnqGK7psPSZpiipqOhsrp5xJqpoZmimcG0ecyoq6GdomQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./transgender-actor-elliot-page-knew-he-wanted-to-be-a-boy-at-age-nine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Transgender actor Elliot Page knew he 'wanted to be a boy' at age NINE">&larr;
