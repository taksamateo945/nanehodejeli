Leah stabbed Pope through the throat and deemed herself leader of the Reapers.</p><p>Likewise What did Frost tell Pope? Obviously, Frost telling Pope everything would mean that Daryl’s deception truly has been exposed, given that he’s aware of Daryl’s relationship with Alexandria and Maggie. That was the implication of the episode’s ending since it showed Pope speaking quietly and Carver laughing.</p><p>What did the Reaper say before blowing up?</p><p>In response, the Reaper drops his knife, smiles, and simply says, “Pope marked you,” before deliberately blowing himself up with a grenade.</p><p>Accordingly, Is Elijah a reaper?</p><p>Despite being noticeably afraid of the Reapers in episode 17, Elijah tries to save Maggie when she’s attacked by them in “Hunted.” Since Elijah consistently exhibits the heroism Pope values, it suggests he has qualities that would’ve allowed him to be accepted as a Reaper in the past.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_are_the_Reapers_after_Maggie></span><strong>Why are the Reapers after Maggie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From this perspective, the Reapers were necessary to prove that Maggie could get in touch with her dark side in order to protect or avenge her own. It’s also likely that she will have to go to that dark place again when she faces off with the Commonwealth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_Reapers_are_there_in_The_Walking_Dead></span><strong>How many Reapers are there in The Walking Dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, he claims that the group speaks in code since Daryl is an outsider that they don’t trust and that they have greater numbers than the 15 Reapers at Meridian.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_the_Reaper_say_to_Maggie></span><strong>What does the Reaper say to Maggie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An unnamed Reaper played by actor Mike Whinnet attacked and hunted Maggie and Daryl (Norman Reedus), before being beaten by our heroes. Rather than allow himself to be captured, the Reaper told Maggie “Pope marked you,” and blew himself up with a grenade.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_the_guy_in_the_woods_say_to_Maggie></span><strong>What did the guy in the woods say to Maggie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We see several people Maggie had been staying with shot down before a man comes for Maggie—only to be surrounded by her group. But the man, dressed in military fatigues, refuses to answer any of Maggie’s questions. Instead, he tells her, “Pope marked you”—and then proceeds to blow himself up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_the_guy_with_the_grenade_say_to_Maggie></span><strong>What did the guy with the grenade say to Maggie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An unnamed Reaper played by actor Mike Whinnet attacked and hunted Maggie and Daryl (Norman Reedus), before being beaten by our heroes. Rather than allow himself to be captured, the Reaper told Maggie “Pope marked you,” and blew himself up with a grenade.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_does_Elijah_wear_a_mask></span><strong>Why does Elijah wear a mask?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since Elijah was introduced, why he wears the mask has been in question by fans. He removed it per Kelly’s (Angel Theory) request, and instead of a fierce-looking person, we saw a timid-looking young man.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Maggie%E2%80%99s_masked_friend></span><strong>Who is Maggie’s masked friend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elijah (TV Series)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Leah_join_the_Reapers></span><strong>Why did Leah join the Reapers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Pope orders Ancheta to fire the hwacha down at the courtyard, despite his men being in the line of fire, Leah kills him. However, she ultimately decides to remain with the Reapers to save what’s left of her family rather than join Daryl. After she betrays Daryl, Leah becomes the leader of the Reapers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_does_Daryl_join_the_Reapers></span><strong>Why does Daryl join the Reapers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As they fled, many were injured, some were killed and Daryl was captured. After some waterboarding, a trial by fire and meeting up with an old love interest, the Reapers’ leader, Pope, was convinced that Daryl wasn’t really part of Maggie’s group. So, he let Daryl join his religiously fanatical crew.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Carol_put_in_Daryl%E2%80%99s_backpack></span><strong>What did Carol put in Daryl’s backpack?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before he leaves, Carol approaches, scooping up a map Daryl dropped. Without asking permission, Carol hops on the back of his motorcycle and slips the map into his backpack pocket.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_attacked_Maggie%E2%80%99s_group></span><strong>Who attacked Maggie’s group?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While it’s not explicitly stated, the group that attacks Maggie, Darryl, Dog, Negan, and party at the end of season 11, episode 2, is likely the Reapers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_mythology_is_the_Grim_Reaper></span><strong>What mythology is the Grim Reaper?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Greek mythology, Chronos, called Father Time, was the king of titans and the father of Zeus. Cronus was a harvest god and carried a sickle, which is a tool used in harvesting grain. The Grim Reaper carrying a scythe is derived from a combination of Chronus and Cronus.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_point_of_the_Reapers_TWD></span><strong>What is the point of the Reapers TWD?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Described as a group of former mercenaries turned religious zealots, the Reapers are the main antagonists of Season 11A of TWD. What they lack in size, they make up in strength and skill, as all of the close-knit members are military-trained and exercise their talent in stealthy attacks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Maggie_a_villain></span><strong>Is Maggie a villain?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not only is The Walking Dead’s Maggie rapidly losing the support of her fellow survivors, she’s actually transforming into a villain. Maggie seems driven by a desperate need for revenge on the Reapers – as if doing so will make amends for her past failures.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_the_reaper_say_walking_dead></span><strong>What does the reaper say walking dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So, ultimately I just straight up asked AMC, and they told me what he said when Maggie asks him why he’s done all this: “Pope marked you.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Pope_that_marked_Maggie></span><strong>Who is Pope that marked Maggie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But why are they hunting down Maggie? In “Home Sweet Home,” we learn that their leader Pope (Ritchie Coster) “marked” Maggie, but we never learn why. The Reapers killed most of the people who resided at Meridian, the community where the Wardens most recently lived.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_female_Reaper_in_walking_dead></span><strong>Who is the female Reaper in walking dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In season 10c of The Walking Dead, we were introduced to a new character named Leah, who we would eventually learn, in season eleven, is a member of the Reapers. The character is played by an actress named Lynn Collins, who is fantastic in this role.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Lydia_in_The_Walking_Dead></span><strong>How old is Lydia in The Walking Dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lydia was 16 when she first appeared on the series in season 9, which was after the time jump. How old is Lydia from The Walking Dead now? This would make her about 17 in current times, potentially 18 depending on her birthday.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Meridian_in_walking_dead></span><strong>What is Meridian in walking dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Meridian is a location in AMC’s The Walking Dead. It was the home of Maggie and her people known as the Wardens before it was attacked and taken over by Reapers. Following the defeat of the Reapers, Meridian was abandoned with Maggie and her surviving people choosing to rebuild the Hilltop instead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Elijah_the_walking_dead></span><strong>How old is Elijah the walking dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elijah Kane (TV Series)</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Elijah Kane</th></tr><tr><td>Hair</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>Early to mid 30s</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Special Tactics Officer in the U.S. Air Force (Pre Apocalypse) Commonwealth Security Lieutenant (Post-Apocalypse)</td></tr><tr><td>Family</td><td>Anya – Wife</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktrR5z6innmWZo3q1tMRmrpqkm567qHnDnpidZZOkuqqv0mZqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lawyer-milloy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lawyer Milloy - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!">&larr;
