The couple was married for about six years before parting ways. Their relationship produced one child.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Tanya Hijazi’s Biography&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Tanya Hijazi</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1972</li><li><strong>Tanya Hijazi’s Age:</strong> 51 years old</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Tanya Hijazi’s Ex-Husband:</strong> Rick James</li><li><strong>Tanya Hijazi’s Children:</strong> Tazman James</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Rick James’ ex-wife</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Tanya Hijazi?</strong></h2><p>Tanya Hijazi was born in the year 1972. However, the exact day of the month in which she was born is not certain. For this reason, her exact age is not clear, but she is clearly now in her 50s. Also, her zodiac sign is not known. It is interesting that despite being so popular as Rick James’ ex-wife, details about her date of birth have remained vague over the years.</p><p>Reports say that Tanya was born in the United States of America. However, details about the exact city or town of her birth remain unknown. What is clear is that she grew up in the USA and is a full-fledged American woman. Because very little is known about Tanya Hijazi’s childhood and background, it is not clear who her parents are or what they did for a living. It is also not certain if she has any siblings or if she is an only child.</p><p>Despite the limited information about her background, some reports say she had a lot of freedom when she was a child and was allowed to express herself a lot while growing up. Because of this, she became a very social person and loved meeting new people. She was always outdoors with friends and loved adventure, especially when she got into her teenage years. Tanya eventually became wiser than her years and was often looked up to by her friends.</p><p>Not much is known about Tanya’s education. There are no details about where she had her elementary or high school education. It is also not certain if she had any college education or the equivalent.</p><h2><strong>How Did Tanya Hijazi and Rick James Meet?</strong></h2><p>As we have explained before, Tanya Hijazi developed a love for the outdoors when she was still a little girl. According to reports, her love for the outdoors and socializing began at a young age, and she was always eager to meet new people and socialize. She was always drawn to activities that involved being around people and having a good time. Even as a child, she would often play outside with her friends and explore nature. As she grew older, this love for the outdoors and socializing only intensified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/hijazi.jpg><p>Long before she turned 18 years, Tanya had always started attending parties with friends to have fun. It was at one of these parties that she met Rick James. Our findings show that in 1989 when Tanya was just 17 years old, she attended a party where she met Rick James. Rick was a well-known musician at the time, and Tanya was immediately struck by his charismatic personality and charm. They struck up a conversation and hit it off, but they didn’t start dating right away.</p><p>It wasn’t until the following year, in 1990, when Tanya had turned 18 years old, that she and Rick James started dating. Tanya was enamored by Rick’s status as a superstar musician and enjoyed the lavish lifestyle that came along with it. They were often seen out and about together, attending parties and events. Tanya even accompanied Rick on some of his tours, further solidifying their bond.</p><p>As their relationship progressed, Tanya’s love for the outdoors and socializing continued to play a significant role in their lives. They often went on adventures together and enjoyed exploring new places. Tanya’s infectious energy and love for life made her a favorite among Rick’s friends and fans.</p><h3><strong>What was The Age Different Between Tanya and Rick James?</strong></h3><p>There was a significant age difference between Tanya Hijazi and Rick James, with Tanya being much younger than James. Tanya was born in the year 1972, making her about 17 years old when she first met Rick James in 1989. On the other hand, Rick James, who was born in 1948, was already 41 years old at the time. This meant that the age gap between the two was a massive 24 years, and this raised some eyebrows.</p><p>When they eventually started dating in 1990, Tanya was 18 years old, and Rick James was 42. Despite the significant age gap, the two lovers were struck by each other’s charm and clung to each other. Tanya Hijazi and Rick James’ significant age difference created quite a buzz when they began dating, and they occasionally made headlines. However, Tanya and Rick James were undeterred and continued their relationship, which became the talk of the town.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/hijazi1.jpg><p>But, despite the initial shock and criticism, many people were also fascinated by their romance. Reports say their shared love for music and adventure held them together, and they bonded over their mutual passion. As their relationship blossomed quickly, they became inseparable. Apparently, for Tanya Hijazi and Rick James, age was just a number.</p><h2><strong>When Did Tanya Hijazi Become Rick James’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Even though they were head over heels in love, Tanya Hijazi and Rick James did not rush into marriage after they kickstarted their romance. Apparently, they wanted to make sure that they were ready for such a significant commitment, and they took their time to build a strong foundation for their relationship.</p><p>Finally, in 1996, Tanya and Rick James decided to take the big step and got married. Details about how the wedding happened are not clear as it is not known where the wedding ceremony took place, but it was undoubtedly a special and joyous occasion for the couple. Family members and several close friends were said to have attended the wedding. Because Rick James was already a popular figure,&nbsp; the wedding was the talk of the town.</p><p>Also, for Tanya Hijazi, marrying Rick James was a dream come true. She had always been a huge fan of his music, and to be able to marry her idol was a dream come true for her. Following their marriage, the couple’s love for each other was evident in everything they did, and they continued to be each other’s biggest supporters.&nbsp;Tanya was often seen at Rick James’ concerts, cheering him on from the sidelines. She was not just a fan; she was his wife, and her unwavering support was a testament to the depth of their love. Together, they went on many adventures and shared countless happy moments.</p><h3><strong>Tanya’s Ex-Husband, Rick James, was a True Music Legend</strong></h3><p>Tanya Hijazi’s ex-husband, Rick James, was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and producer who rose to fame in the late 1970s and 1980s with his unique blend of funk, soul, and rock music. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative musicians of his time, and his music continues to be celebrated by fans and fellow musicians alike. One of Rick James’ greatest strengths as a musician was his ability to fuse different genres of music to create a sound that was uniquely his own.</p><p>His music was characterized by his distinctive voice, electrifying guitar riffs, funky basslines, and infectious rhythms, which made his songs instantly recognizable and unforgettable. He was also a talented songwriter and producer who wrote many of his own songs and produced albums for other artists, including Teena Marie and the Mary Jane Girls. Some of Rick James’ most popular and iconic songs include “Super Freak,” “Give It to Me Baby,” “Mary Jane,” and “You and I.”</p><p>These songs, along with many others, helped to define the sound of funk music in the 1980s and continue to be beloved by fans of all ages. Rick James’ legacy as a musician is also marked by his influence on other artists. His music has been sampled and referenced by countless musicians in a variety of genres, including hip-hop, R&B, and rock. He was also a mentor to many young musicians, including Prince, who was heavily influenced by James’ music and style.</p><p>In addition to his musical contributions, Rick James was also known for his flamboyant personality and his larger-than-life persona. He was a trailblazer who pushed boundaries and challenged the status quo, both in his music and his personal life. He cemented his place in music history as one of the greatest musicians of all time, and his music continues to be celebrated and enjoyed by fans around the world.</p><h3><strong>They Have a Son Together</strong></h3><p>While they were together, Tanya Hijazi and Rick James had a son who was named Tazman James. Tazman was born in 1993. It is interesting to note that Tazman was born before the couple got married. At the time of Tazman’s birth, Tanya and James had been dating for about three years. Tanya was very fond of Tazman and showered him with love and affection as a child. It is also noteworthy that Tazman’s arrival helped to rekindle their romance, and they became even closer as a family.</p><p>Unfortunately, the happiness they got over the arrival of their son was short-lived, as Tanya and James were sent to prison in 1993, shortly after Tazman’s birth, when they were convicted of assault. Tanya was away from her son for more than a year, and James was away for even longer. When they were released from prison, they did their best to make up for the time they had lost with their son. They spent a lot of time with Tazman and tried to be there for him as much as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/Tanya1.jpg><p>Now in his 30s, Tazman James has followed in his father’s footsteps and has become a singer himself. However, he has not achieved the same level of success that his famous father had. Not even close. Nonetheless, Tazman is still pursuing his passion for music and carving out his own path in the industry. Tazman and his mother remain very close to this day, and their bond has only grown stronger over the years.</p><p>Interestingly, Tazman James is the only child of his biological parents, but his family tree branches out to include step-siblings as well. This is because his father, Rick James, had relationships with other women and fathered three more children besides Tazman. Rick James used to be in a relationship with Syville Morgan, a former singer and songwriter. This relationship produced two children; a daughter named Tyenza and a son named Rick Jr. In addition, his father has another son named Trey Hardesty James from a different relationship.</p><p>This means that Tazman has three step-siblings who are all related to him from his father’s side. While it is unclear what kind of relationship they share, it is believed that they are reasonably close to one another because they are family. Regardless of their circumstances, they share a familial bond that can be a source of comfort and support throughout their lives.</p><h3><strong>Tanya’s Marriage to Rick James Crumbled After 6 Years</strong></h3><p>Without a doubt, Tanya Hijazi and Rick James’ marriage was one that was filled with passion and love, but unfortunately, it was not meant to last. Their marital union, which began in 1996, ended in 2002 after six years of marriage. When they got married, it seemed like they had found their soulmate in each other, but as time went by, their relationship began to deteriorate.</p><p>Although the exact reasons for their divorce remain unknown, there are reports that suggest that the couple started having lots of fights toward the end of their marriage, and these fights and arguments are believed to have played a significant role in the breakdown of their union. It is possible that their differences became too much to bear, and they found it difficult to reconcile their conflicting views and opinions.</p><p>At the time of their divorce, Tazman James, the son they had together, was just nine years old. It is unclear how the divorce affected their son, but it is likely that it was a challenging time for him, as he had to navigate the difficulties of his parent’s separation. Unfortunately, just two years after they divorced, Rick James passed away.</p><p>According to our findings, James was discovered deceased in his Los Angeles residence at the Oakwood Toluca Hills apartment complex, located near Burbank, by his caretaker on the morning of August 6, 2004. He was 56 years of age. Despite their differences, Tanya was devasted by her ex-husband’s demise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/hijazi2.jpg><h3><strong>Tanya Hijazi Spent 15 Months in Prison For Assault</strong></h3><p>While they were together, Tanya Hijazi and Rick James were known for getting involved in various mischievous acts, and their actions eventually led to their imprisonment for committing grievous offenses, including assault. One of the incidents that led to their imprisonment involved Tanya and James assaulting a woman named Mary Sauger.</p><p>According to reports, Tanya and James had invited Sauger to their room when the assault happened. During the incident, Tanya, for some reason, became angry with Sauger and started slapping her while they were all having drinks in the hotel suite. James also joined in the assault and slapped Sauger until she lost consciousness. Not satisfied, Tanya and James allegedly revived Sauger with water, only for James to slap her again and choke her.</p><p>Sauger later said she did not go to the hospital until two days later after consulting an attorney, who advised her that she could seek civil damages against James and Tanya. Tanya was eventually charged to court for assaulting Sauger <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">and pleaded guilty</a> to one count of assault with a deadly weapon. Because of the severity of her crimes, Tanya was supposed to be sentenced to 4 years in prison.</p><p>However, after entering into a plea bargain, her sentence was reduced to 15 months. In the plea bargain, the prosecutors dismissed ten charges against Tanya in another assault incident involving James in return for her plea in the Sauger case. Tanya eventually went to prison and spent 15 months there before being released.</p><p>On his own part, Rick James also went on trial for a series of charges, including mayhem, for the Sauger attack and for allegedly burning as well as sexually assaulting another woman in another incident that happened on July 16, 1991. According to prosecutors in the 1991 case, James and Hijazi allegedly used cocaine with a woman at James’ Hollywood Hills home above Studio City.</p><p>They then reportedly tied her naked to a chair, with James burning her legs and stomach using a hot cocaine pipe. The woman was then forced to engage in sexual acts with Hijazi while James watched.&nbsp;The woman claimed that she, James, Hijazi, and several others had been using cocaine continuously for nearly a week. She also stated that she had previously engaged in consensual sexual activity with James on at least two occasions.</p><p>In August of 1991, the woman went to a hospital seeking medical attention for burns on her legs and stomach. Hospital officials notified the police and James and Hijazi were taken into custody and later released on bail. When the second assault incident happened with Sauger, the police revived the first battery case and dragged both Hiujzi and James to court. James was later sentenced to 3 years in prison.</p><p>It was only after they were released from prison that they went ahead and got married in 1996.</p><h2><strong>What Does James’ Ex-wife Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Tanya Hijazi spent a lot of time traveling with her ex-husband, Rick James, and just exploring the world with him. For a long time, she didn’t really aspire to be anything else. However, she later pursued a career in the field of costume and fashion design after her divorce from James. This provided her with opportunities to work with prominent figures in the American entertainment industry.</p><p>During her career, Tanya Hijazi made some contributions to different productions, including the 2005 Horror/Thriller film, The Unseen, for which she worked as an assistant to the costume designer. Her creativity, attention to detail, and passion for her work made her an invaluable member of the production team. She also appeared in the 2008 documentary series, Unsung, which took a look at some of the top R&B and soul artists of the last several decades.</p><p>In addition to her work in the film industry, Hijazi also made appearances on television. She appeared in the 2009 documentary I’m Rick James, which provided an in-depth look at the life and career of the famous musician who was her ex-husband. In this documentary, Hijazi shared her insights and experiences of working with James, offering a unique perspective on his life.</p><p>Apparently, Hijazi’s contributions to the entertainment industry were not limited to her professional work. She also appeared in the 2021 profile of her ex-husband, B!tchin: The Sound and Fury of Rick James.&nbsp;This documentary provided a comprehensive look at James’s life and career, and Hijazi’s presence added a personal touch that helped to make the documentary even more engaging and insightful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/hijazi3.jpg><h3><strong>Did Tanya Hijazi Remarry After Rick James?</strong></h3><p>After she parted ways with Rick James, Tanya Hijazi stayed out of the spotlight for a while, and during this time, it was believed that she did not date anyone but remained single as she tried to get some work done in the film industry. However, this changed in 2012, when she made headlines with her romance with actor and rapper Darius McCrary.</p><p>Tanya Hijazi and Darius McCrary made headlines when it was revealed that they were engaged to be married. For the record, Darius McCrary, a talented American actor, rapper, singer, and producer, has made a name for himself in the entertainment industry with his impressive performances on stage and screen. The news of their engagement quickly spread across various social media platforms, and people couldn’t stop talking about it.</p><p>What made this story even more intriguing was the fact that Darius McCrary was actually the godson of Tanya’s ex-husband, Rick James. This revelation added an unexpected twist to the already surprising news. Darius McCrary had previously opened up about his close relationship with Rick James during an interview with Vlad TV in 2020. He spoke about how he had hung out with James the night before he died and revealed that James was his godfather.</p><p>Given their close relationship, many people were surprised that Darius McCrary would be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with his godfather’s ex-wife. The couple later confirmed their romance in a later interview in 2021, where Tanya and Darius McCrary sat down to address rumors about their friendship. During the interview, the reporter asked when the couple had last kissed, and Tanya gave her soon-to-be-husband a sweet kiss on the lips.</p><p>But, despite their widely reported engagement, there have been no reports of the couple tying the knot. It’s possible that they’re taking their time and enjoying their relationship before taking the next step. Only time will tell what the future holds for this unexpected couple.</p><h2><strong>Where is Tanya Hijazi Now?</strong></h2><p>As we have mentioned, following her divorce from Rick James, Tanya Hijazi’s public presence significantly diminished, and she has been relatively absent from the media spotlight. While there was a brief moment of interest when news broke of her engagement to Darius McCrary in 2021, she has since retreated into a low profile.</p><p>It’s unclear whether Hijazi’s absence from the public eye is a deliberate choice or simply a result of her personal life being less newsworthy. However, her limited visibility makes it challenging to ascertain her current activities and whereabouts. It is not clear if she has any other business aside from her work in the movies.</p><p>But, despite her lack of recent public appearances, it has been reported that Hijazi currently resides in the United States and is said to be actively pursuing opportunities in the film industry. This suggests that she has not abandoned her passion for entertainment and may be working behind the scenes on various projects. It remains to be seen if and when Hijazi will choose to re-emerge into the public eye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmq5qmqZZ6qbXJmrGiZaedvG610malqK9dp7akt4yjmKado2KyuXnWop2eZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./collin-morikawa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Collin Morikawa- Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career">&larr;
