The TV personality has only been a father for two weeks to<a href=#> his son</a>, but he has been a dad to his four-legged friend for years. He is fiercely protective of both his boys, so critics need to watch how they come at him.</p><p>What started as a funny Instagram story, has now turned into drama. It all began when the Watch What Happens Live host shared a video of him playfully talking to his dog, Wacha. The pooch was laying in the middle of several plush toys that were assumed to be for Cohen’s son Benjamin.</p><p>“Did you just eat my son’s stuffed Torah that the Rabbi gave him Wacha? And now you’re exhausted? That was my son’s Torah. Did you want to explain to my son what you did? And what do I tell the Rabbi? Wacha? Wacha!” Cohen said in an entirely funny and joking manner to his dog.</p><p>In no time the 50-year-old first-time father was flooded with comments on the “big problem” he had on his hands concerning Wacha. People he didn’t even know were dad shaming him for the way he handled the situation. Some also indicated having the pooch was not in the best interest of baby Benjamin.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt3-f-_Fmxi/</p><p>The critics’ messages forced Cohen to respond in a manner that was perfect. He took time to explain to the haters that he did not, in fact, have a big problem on his hands. In several Instagram story videos, the TV personality made it clear Wacha is not jealous, as well as that he now has two loves in his life.</p><p>“Wacha didn’t know that the Torah toy, we’re talking about a Torah toy, belonged to the baby. He just had his eye on a purple toy, and he wanted to rip it apart. It’s not that deep. Stand down. Everything’s fine in the West Village,” one message said.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Another adorable video is of Andy Cohen explaining to his beautiful dog Wacha that people are judgy, so sometimes they have to be a little more careful. He went on to tell the haters that sometimes a Torah toy is just a toy. It is not only super cute but an excellent way for the new father to clap back. Kudos to you Cohen!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRo7G6ecKon56mXZmupXnSoZimnZRis7C%2BjKWcrayZo7RusM6gZJ6ZpGK1qr%2BMrKanq12pvLp5056jpatdmL%2BqwMicqmarpJa7pXnDqK6nZWJphHKDlGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10125927-nba-rumors-james-harden-waiting-on-paul-george-contract-to-align-with-sf-kawhi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA Rumors: James Harden Waiting on Paul George Contract to 'Align' with SF, Kawhi | News, Scores, H">&larr;
