He claimed that he was the happiest and that he wanted to share his happiness with everyone around him.&nbsp;However, one thing he refused to provide was the name of his lover. Until today, no one knew who he was dating. As soon as the baby news hit the internet, keyboard detectives went to work, and now we know a little more about who his baby mom is.</p><h2>Post Malone Announces the Birth of His First Child</h2><p>Malone revealed the happy news that his child will be born on May 3, 2022. He chatted with TMZ, expressing his opinions on the matter and how he planned to approach things from then on.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm eager for this new chapter in my life; I‚Äôm the happy I‚Äôve ever been, and I‚Äôve been miserable for as long as I can remember,‚Äù he told the site. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to take care of my body, my family, and my friends, and to spread as much love as we possibly can every day.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post-Malone-2.jpg alt="Post Malone" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, this was not the exclusive announcement that everyone anticipated. Malone had already celebrated the news with his closest friends and family the week before at a private party in Southern California.<br>Furthermore, TMZ reported his at-the-time unidentified girlfriend did not like being in the limelight. They had been working on their relationship in secret and were pleased with the results.</p><p>Following this, on May 9, 2022, Malone was photographed in West Hollywood with someone claiming to be his girlfriend. A few photos of the pair were extensively circulated on social media, but nothing came of it in terms of her identification.&nbsp;She was wearing a mask, so her face was also hidden.&nbsp;However, a little more investigation found a lot more.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@PostMalone</a> shopping with his girlfriend in West Hollywood üëÄ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BhVR1Tjptq</a></p><p>‚Äî postygoat (@GoatPosty) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 7, 2021</a></p><h2>The Identity of Post Malone‚Äôs Girlfriend Has Been Revealed</h2><p>People close to Malone knew who his girlfriend was even if no one else did. That‚Äôs where the information came from. Someone called Courtney Rowe shared a group photo with Malone on October 23, 2021. The artist was standing with a group of individuals in the photo, one of them was a lady who resembled the one he was seen in West Hollywood.</p><p>‚ÄúI just want Jamie to know she‚Äôs loved and to try to ignore the haters/bullies,‚Äù Rowe tweeted, confirming Malone‚Äôs partner‚Äôs name as Jamie. ‚ÄúYou are stunning, and the Post Malonials adore you.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post-Malone-3.jpg alt="Post Malone" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Few people noticed this tweet, but those who did were directed to Jamie‚Äôs social media. Fewer still grabbed screenshots of her Instagram and shared them on Twitter.&nbsp;On May 4, 2022, one of these tweets was sent. Someone using the username magda posted an image of Jamie‚Äôs Instagram with the message, ‚ÄúPost Malone‚Äôs girlfriend Jamie is so lovely omg.‚Äù</p><p>Even more, was disclosed in the comments to that tweet. Malone had apparently been concealing Jamie in plain sight.&nbsp;Another person pointed out that he had been wearing a necklace with her name and had her photo on his phone cover all along.&nbsp;Then, on May 10, Deux Moi received an anonymous submission concerning Malone and his partner. According to the tip, Jamie, who is Korean, erased her Instagram after learning of her pregnancy.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinqKukYrqiuM6nnGaZnpl6qbXSZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1kmqqVYrK5vMScq6Kml2LBqbHIq2SfoaKowW6vx6KjnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./porsha-williams-does-not-mind-working-with-nene-leakes-as-some-rhoa-fans-hope-she-will-land-a-spin-off-after-the-success-of-porshas-having-a-baby-282720.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Porsha Williams Does Not Mind Working With NeNe Leakes As Some RHOA Fans Hope She Will Land A ">&larr;
